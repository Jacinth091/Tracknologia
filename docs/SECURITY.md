# Security

Tracknologia uses defense in depth rather than relying on Next.js alone.

## Security layers

## Authentication

Supabase Auth owns authentication/session mechanics:

- signup/login;
- password handling;
- password reset;
- session/JWT handling;
- authenticated user identity.

Tracknologia must not implement its own password hashing or JWT system.

## Authorization

Tracknologia owns application permissions:

- current Provider membership;
- membership role;
- Provider ownership of Repair/Repair Request;
- allowed Repair state changes;
- public vs private data exposure.

An authenticated user is not automatically authorized for a resource.

## Provider isolation

Provider A must not read or mutate Provider B's Repairs or Repair Requests.

Enforce this twice:

1. application authorization in Tracknologia features;
2. PostgreSQL RLS policies as defense in depth.

## Server Actions and Route Handlers

Treat every mutation interface as externally callable.

Every write must:

1. resolve authenticated context;
2. validate input;
3. verify Provider/resource authorization;
4. invoke the relevant feature module;
5. expose only the necessary result.

## Input validation

Use Zod on the server for untrusted input.

Client-side validation improves usability but is not a security control.

## Public tracking

Tracking codes must be difficult to enumerate and should not equal sequential ticket numbers.

The public tracking feature returns only a safe `PublicRepairView`, for example:

```text
provider name
device summary
current status
customer-visible update
last updated timestamp
```

Never expose internal notes, private identifiers, contact data or complete Repair rows through the public interface.

## Public Repair Requests

Public request forms need:

- server-side Zod validation;
- request/body-size controls;
- abuse/rate limiting before broad public exposure;
- optional CAPTCHA/bot protection only when actual abuse warrants it.

## Environment secrets

Browser-safe Supabase project configuration may use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.

Privileged service-role/secret keys must never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, appear in browser bundles, or be committed to Git.

## Server-only implementation

Use server-only imports/structure around database and privileged implementation code so Client Components cannot accidentally depend on it.

## Security tests

At minimum test:

- Provider A can read Provider A Repair;
- Provider A cannot read/update Provider B Repair;
- Provider A cannot accept Provider B Repair Request;
- unauthenticated users cannot access Provider data;
- public tracking does not expose internal notes/contact data;
- invalid tracking identifiers reveal no sensitive information;
- accepted Repair Request cannot create multiple Repairs;
- illegal Repair status transitions are rejected.
